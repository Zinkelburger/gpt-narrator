Start in a bustling city center (what year?) 2024 baby! Can even get the date from time.now() or whatever (I like that)

Can have people to assasinate (when prompeted who is near by) Maybe you are walking by a bar and see some shady characters. And if you choose to interact with them, you go for a drink, some mob boss comes storming in furious and boom you're in the mob. User is able to get kill or hurt. (if kill , say game over and restart everything)  

Need to parse the input into chunks. Significant preprocessing steps to break the story up into chunks, so the AI can be appropriately prompted. E.g. any "space invaders" prompts during the "gardening" prompts will be useless
Several AI steps. AI generates the prompt. Can prompt it with "You are generating a prompt for an RPG game" or is that too meta (do let it know its RPG game). Feed that prompt to another AI

Things humorously go wrong. But GPT is very bad at humor. Maybe can have it generate a significant amount of the story, and only feed it to the user in chunks? So it is potentially more coherent. (provide list of jokes? and possible scenarios?)

Limit user's ability to that of a human (no super power). Able to say "that action isn't possible" or equivalent.
Limitations: Starting with $0 dollar on pocket (have to get a job? Or not interesting if you have no money. What about something you can trade, something silly like a croissant). Equiped with a folding knife.

Can buy a house in the suburbs, start a garden, go for a hike in the woods.
Hike:
Friend almost falls and breaks their head open. 
Birds steal your food. 
Able to get attack by bear.
You spill your water

Gardening:
Rabbit eats your flowers
Forget to water your carrots on a hot day
Enjoy your delicious food

Beach:
Pooped on by seagull
Tall wave knocks over your sandcastle
Forgot sunscreen
Slip on a rock and hurt your butt

Ability to go to the future with cryogenic facilities.
If you ask someone where it is they say like "how the fuck should I know".
Can only ask people who know things

Navy:
Food poisoning
 WW3 (lol0)
Have to clean dust out of the torpedo tubes
- Lied to in job description, are actually a janitor

space:
Drink from the wrong water supply (pee is usually cleaned to be potable in space)(lo l, you drink pee by accident)
pressed the self distruct button (solve a riddle to turn it off)
In a constant space war against the soviets or chinese, will be prompted by ground control to perform an event to be the first person to do it in space
    (events such as sneezing, jumping in zero gravity, first grafity, first to eat 50 twinkies in sace)

random events:
you shoes gets untie and you fall.
Sneeze at the wrong time.
Get snitched on by bystanders



- In this game, everything always goes wrong, and its kind of funny how it always ruins your fun. Still can progress, just less linearly than you'd expect
