Able to serve as a base for text-based GPT projects

Give it things you want in the story, and it will only prompt the AI with them when it the details are important (simple heuristic for that? Just like "if contains xxx word, prompt an AI to see if it is relevant. If it is relevant, prompt an AI to create a prompt for the next phase of the story")

Contains a simple implementation of the classic "you are in a dark room with a door" text based game, where you have to look around to find things.

Abstract away the details, and allow the writer to focus on the story

- also give voice output
